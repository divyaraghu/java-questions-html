</div>
<div class="question">
<b>

</b></div>

</b></div>
<div class="answer">
An object reference can be cast to an interface reference when the object implements the referenced interface.
</div>
<div class="question">
<b>
How many objects will be created in the following code?</b><br/>
    a. String s1="Welcome";  <br/>
    String s2="Welcome";  <br/>
    String s3="Welcome"; <br/>
    b. String s1 =  new String("Welcome");

Only one object "Welcome" will be created in the string literal(constant). b-> 2 objects, one in string literal and other in heap
</div>
<div class="question">
<b>

5.1 How do you create annotations in java?

<div class="question">Why we need to add annotations?</div>
<div class="answer">
We give authority to spring to create objects for that.
@Repository for Dao classes. Helps to handle persistent related exceptions that spring provides when we add this annotation to dao class. The root exception of persistence exceptions is DataAccessException
@Service - service layer should be marked when this annotation, spring will have some internal exception handling or features related to this annotation. Or spring may come up with new features for this exception, that time we need not change our code
</div>
<div class="question"> Difference between @component and @bean</div>
<div class="answer">
@component use it for your own classes. Spring will automatically inject that particular class during component scan. Class level annotation 

@bean - method level annotation, we define the bean with id and tell spring to inject the bean. It's used for injecting services from third party jars.
</div>
<div class="question">Difference between inject and autowired? </div>
<div class="answer">
Autowired is from spring, inject is from java
</div>
<div class="question"> Bean life cycle annotations</div>
<div class="answer">@postconstruct (will be called after the bean is instantiated) and @predestroy (Will be called before bean is destroyed)</div>

<div class="question"> How HashMap works internally</div>
<div class="answer">Hashmap is stored as a linked link internally. It’ll  have the key, value and a node (which points to the next node) 
Using the equals method - keys will be checked to see whether they are the same key or not
Hashcode - hashcode will return the integer representation of the object’s reference. Using that only index of that particular entry from the linked list will be retrieved. 

When we override equals methods its mandatory to override the hashcode method as well. When we call the put method, it calculatets the hashcode and find the index of the object where it has to be stored in the bucket (array of nodes)
