1. How will you concat three strings in sql?
SELECT emp_name||' ' || job_name AS "Employee & Job" FROM employees ;

2. Display all employess with 15% hike in salary
select emp_name, concat('$ ',salary+salary*.15) as new_salary FROM employees ;

3. Display employees whose hire_date is in Jan month
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE to_char(hire_date, 'mon')='jan';

select * from employees where to_char(hire_date,'YYYY') = '1991'


4. Same time contains emp_id and manager_id(who is another employee), find the employees and their corresponding manager_id - do a self join
select a.emp_name as Employee, b.emp_name as Manager from employees a INNER JOIN employees b ON a.manager_id = b.emp_id

5. Add unique and not null, primary key constraints to a tab<#if show_header>
ALTER TABLE DEPARTMENT
CHANGE COLUMN LOCATION LOCATION VARCHAR(33) NOT NULL;

ALTER TABLE DEPARTMENT
CHANGE COLUMN DeptName DeptName VARCHAR(15) UNIQUE;

ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEE
ADD PRIMARY KEY (EmpCode);

6. Drop a column from the TABLE
ALTER TABLE employee
DROP column DOB;

7. Add a column to the TABLE - adds a column after a column in the table
ALTER TABLE Employee
ADD column DOB DATE 
AFTER Emp_Name

8. Change a column
ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEE
CHANGE COLUMN Salary Salary DECIMAL(6,2);


9. query all names where second letter starts with a  
select * from employee where name like '_a%';

10. query all names where the second letter is either a or c or f
select * from employee where name like '_[acf]%'

11. query all names where the second letter is between a and f
select * from employee where name like '_[a-f]'

12. Query all names where the first letter should not be a
select * from employee where name like '[!a]%'

13. Inner join query
select E.EMPFNAME, E.EMPLNAME, E.DEPTCODE, D.DEPTNAME, D.LOCATION 
from EMPLOYEE as E INNER JOIN DEPARTMENT as D ON 
E.DEPTCODE = D.DEPTCODE 
ORDER BY E.EMPFNAME,D.LOCATION

if we dont give d. or e. or employee. near DEPTCODE --> it'll lead to ambiguous error


14. Concat queries and addition
 select concat(EMPFNAME,' ' ,EMPLNAME) as EmployeeName, Salary+Commission from employee order by EmployeeName

 15. where should come before group by
 16. All columns present in the where (not the columns present in aggregrate functions like count, sum etc) must be present in the group by list

17. Create a view - view is nothing but a virtual table, it has columns and rows like a normal table and can be queried upon. 
We can create a view and have complex queries/functions being called inside the view. 

create view Manager_Details
as
select e.empCode, concat(e.empfname, ' ', e.emplname) as Employee_Name,d.deptname, concat(e1.empfname, ' ', e1.emplname) as Manager_Name
from employee as e 
JOIN 
employee as e1 
ON e.Manager = e1.empCode
INNER JOIN
department as d
ON d.deptcode = e.deptcode

Now we can query the Manager_Details like any other normal table.

View disadvantages
Each time the view is queried, the select statement is executed because the view has to return up to date results
Creating views for large tables will lead to usage of large amount of physical memory
